# NoStickmansDie
An endless-running game that players need to control stickmen to prevent them from falling on the lowest floor. When a stickman falls on a floor that is not the lowest floor, this stickman go to the lower floor and there is a new stickman spawn on the current floor. The harder the mode, the more floors players need to control and speed increases over time.
